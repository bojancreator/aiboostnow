        q: 'What is AI Boost for Joomla?',
        a: 'AI Boost for Joomla is an all-in-one SEO and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) system plugin for Joomla 4, 5, and 6. It automatically generates Schema.org JSON-LD structured data, an XML sitemap with hreflang, OpenGraph and Twitter Card tags, a robots.txt with AI crawler rules, llms.txt for AI-readable site description, and integrations for Google Analytics 4, Google Tag Manager, Meta Pixel, and IndexNow — all from a single plugin configuration panel.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How is AI Boost for Joomla different from other Joomla SEO plugins?',
        a: 'Most Joomla SEO plugins focus on traditional Google SEO: meta tags, redirects, and basic sitemap generation. AI Boost for Joomla is designed for the AI Search era of 2025–2026. It adds the signals that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews use to cite and recommend content: Schema.org JSON-LD with 13 site type presets, FAQPage auto-detection, llms.txt, IndexNow for instant indexing, and a robots.txt that correctly handles 25+ AI crawlers.',

        q: 'Does the plugin work with Joomla 4, 5, and 6?',

        q: 'Which PHP versions are supported?',

      {
        q: 'Is the plugin compatible with YooTheme Pro, Helix Ultimate, and other Joomla templates?',
        a: 'Yes. AI Boost for Joomla is a system plugin — it operates independently of the template and is injected into the page before the template renders. It has been tested with Cassiopeia (the Joomla default), YooTheme Pro, Helix Ultimate, T4 Framework, Helium, and all standards-compliant Joomla templates.',

After installation, go to System → Manage → Plugins, search for "AI Boost", and click the red circle to enable it (it turns green). Then click the plugin name to open the configuration panel.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What should I do if the installation fails?',
        a: 'The most common causes are: PHP version below 8.1 (check your hosting PHP version), file upload size limit (the ZIP is under 1 MB, so this is rare), or a permissions issue on the Joomla plugins directory. If the Extension Manager shows an error message, include it when you contact support@aiboostnow.com and we will help you resolve it.',

        q: 'Can I use the plugin on a localhost or staging environment?',

This prevents staging content from accidentally being indexed.',

The plugin does not load any third-party scripts on the frontend except the analytics tags you explicitly enable (GA4, GTM, Meta Pixel). In our testing, the impact on Time to First Byte is under 5ms with caching enabled.',

AI Boost for Joomla generates Schema.org JSON-LD automatically and injects it into every page\'s <head>. You select your site type (from 13 presets), fill in your organisation details, and the correct schema is generated without any coding.',

Sites that want to be accurately cited by AI search engines benefit from it. It is not required for basic SEO, but for any site targeting AI-driven discovery in 2025–2026, it is a meaningful signal. AI Boost for Joomla generates it dynamically on the Professional and Agency plans.',

        a: 'IndexNow is a protocol that notifies Bing, Yandex, and Seznam the moment you publish or update a page. In the Analytics tab, enable IndexNow and click "Generate API Key". The plugin generates a unique key, serves the key verification file at the correct URL, and automatically sends IndexNow notifications whenever you save a Joomla article. Pages are typically indexed within minutes of publication instead of waiting for the next crawl cycle.',

        a: 'Yes. AI Boost for Joomla integrates with Joomla\'s Custom Fields system.

When a custom field value is present for an article, it takes precedence over the global defaults.',
